# 🏦 Loan Sanction Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan will be sanctioned or not based on applicant data. The end-to-end process involves data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and building machine learning models for binary classification.

## 📌 Project Objectives
To analyze and understand loan applicant data through statistical and graphical techniques.

To identify key features influencing loan approval decisions.

To build and evaluate classification models for accurate prediction of loan sanction status.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Distribution of individual features like applicant income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between target variable and independent features like education vs loan status, credit history vs loan status, etc.

## Tools Used:

NumPy, Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## 🔧 Feature Engineering
Handled missing values through imputation strategies.

Categorical variables were encoded using label encoding or one-hot encoding as appropriate.

Created derived features to improve model performance.

## 🤖 Model Building
Implemented and compared the following classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Each model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## 🧠 Model Evaluation
Used train-test split and cross-validation for robust model evaluation.

Identified key features like Credit History, Applicant Income, and Loan Amount as top predictors of loan sanction.

## Tools & Libraries Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

NumPy, Pandas

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (for ML models and preprocessing)
